### That's not even funny 

##### What am I doing with my life 

Anyways, welcome. 

I'm Tan Yi Wei, a Secondary 4 student of Pei Hwa Secondary School. 

## About myself 

When I have free time, I enjoy programming interesting things and listening to E-books. Aside from that, I also enjoy playing games like Osu! and learning new things. 

Regarding my strengths, I think that my main strength is being a jack-of-all-trades (Master of a small handful). This is (I think) a result of my enjoyment of learning new things. Thus, my knowledge extends to, and likely beyond, 

- C++ 
- C 
- Python 
- Rust 
- Keyboards 
- Drawing 
- Soldering 
- Javascript 
- HTML and CSS 
- Using power tools 
- CAD designing 
- 3-D printing (Don't have a printer, but school does) 
- Physics and Chemistry 
- Random information and data 
- Et cetera
